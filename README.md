This works with 3 API's: GitHub, Harvest, and Unsplash

### GitHub

Add your GitHub API keys (only read authorization is needed), and Dash will pull in:

- All assigned issues
- All assigned pull requests
- All pull requests where your review is requested and your review is not requested

### Harvest

Add your Harvest API key and it will pull in all your Harvest projects, and if you have set a hours target for the month it will display:

- Your Harvest projects
- The number of hours performed on the projects
- The number of weekdays left in the month
- If an hours target has been set for the month, the number of hours needed per remaining weekday to hit the target

### Unsplash

No API keys needed here! Just a new random pretty picture served hot every day. If you don't like it, there's a button to fetch another.

To start your Phoenix server: 

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
